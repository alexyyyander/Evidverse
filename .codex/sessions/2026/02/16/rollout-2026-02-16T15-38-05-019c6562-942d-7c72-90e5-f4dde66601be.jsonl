You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"0d3b2818a77fee750460c2e6ff505b47f16ac095","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:alexyyyander/Evidverse.git"}}}

Code Style Guidelines\n\n### Python (Backend)\n\n#### Imports (PEP 8)\n```python\n# Standard library\nfrom typing import Any, List, Optional\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Third-party\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession\n\n# Local application\nfrom app.api import deps\nfrom app.models.user import User\nfrom app.schemas.project import ProjectCreate\nfrom app.services.project_service import ProjectService\n```\n\n#### Type Hints\n- Always use type hints for function parameters and return types\n- Use `Optional[T]` instead of `T | None` for compatibility\n- Prefer explicit return types: `async def foo() -> List[Project]:`\n\n#### Async/Await\n- Use async/await for all database operations\n- Always `await` database commits and queries\n- Use `AsyncSession` from `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio`\n\n#### Error Handling\n- Use `HTTPException` from FastAPI for HTTP errors\n- Include meaningful error messages and detail\n- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ProjectService`)\n- Functions/methods: `snake_case` (e.g., `create_project`)\n- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`\n- Database models: `PascalCase` matching table name\n- Pydantic schemas: `PascalCase` with suffix (e.g., `ProjectCreate`)\n\n#### File Organization\n- API endpoints: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`\n- Service layer: `backend/app/services/`\n- Models: `backend/app/models/`\n- Schemas: `backend/app/schemas/`\n- Workers: `backend/app/workers/`\n\n---\n\n### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)\n\n#### Path Aliases\n- `@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in tsconfig.json)\n- Use absolute imports: `import Button from \"@/components/ui/button\"`\n\n#### Client vs Server Components\n```typescript\n// Client component - for interactive UI\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\n// Server component - default, for data fetching\nimport { getData } from \"@/lib/api\";\n```\n\n#### Component Structure\n```typescript\n// Prefer this pattern for exports\nexport default function ComponentName() {\n  // component logic\n}\n\n// Named exports for utilities/hooks\nexport function helperFunction() { }\n```\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `GitGraph.tsx`)\n- Hooks: `camelCase` with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuthToken`)\n- Utilities: `camelCase` (e.g., `cn.ts`)\n- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Project`)\n\n#### State Management\n- Server state: React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)\n- Client state: Zustand (`@/store/`)\n- Avoid useState for server-fetched data\n\n#### Tailwind CSS\n- Use existing design tokens from `tailwind.config.ts`\n- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS\n- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes\n\n---\n\n### Prettier Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"printWidth\": 100,\n  \"semi\": true,\n  \"singleQuote\": false,\n  \"trailingComma\": \"all\"\n}\n```\n\n### ESLint Configuration\n\n- Extends: `next/core-web-vitals`\n- Restricts Radix UI imports to `src/components/ui/` only\n- Override exists for UI component files\n\n---\n\n## 3. Project-Specific Guidelines\n\n### Before Starting Development\n\n1. **Always check** `plan/current_stage&FAQ.md` for current stage and priorities\n2. Read the corresponding stage plan (e.g., `plan/stage_plan_dev_v2/stage_*.md`)\n3. Understand the goals and functional requirements\n\n### Git Workflow\n\n- Commit messages should reference the stage: `feat(stage01): implement user model`\n- Commit after each stage test is passed\n- Avoid committing secrets, `.env` files, or large binary data\n- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- **Backend**: Use pytest - all tests must pass before commit\n- **Frontend**: Use Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E\n- Run full test suite before submitting: `npm run check` (frontend) + `pytest` (backend)\n\n### API Design\n\n- Follow RESTful conventions\n- Use Pydantic schemas for request/response validation\n- Document endpoints with docstrings\n- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n\n### Database\n\n- Use Alembic for migrations\n- Always generate migration after model changes\n- Use async SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships\n\n---\n\n## 4. Technology Stack Reference\n\n| Layer | Technology |\n|-------|------------|\n| Backend Framework | FastAPI |\n| Database | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy (async) |\n| Task Queue | Celery + RabbitMQ |\n| Cache | Redis |\n| Storage | MinIO/S3 |\n| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router) |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS |\n| State | Zustand + React Query |\n| Testing | Vitest + Playwright |\n| Linting | ESLint |\n| Formatting | Prettier |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Tasks Reference\n\n### Create a new API endpoint\n1. Add route in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`\n2. Add service method in `backend/app/services/`\n3. Add Pydantic schemas in `backend/app/schemas/`\n4. Add tests in `backend/tests/`\n\n### Create a new frontend component\n1. Add to `frontend/src/components/` (use existing patterns)\n2. Add UI components to `frontend/src/components/ui/`\n3. Use `@/lib/api/` for API calls\n4. Add tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/`\n\n### Database migration\n1. Modify model in `backend/app/models/`\n2. Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"description\"`\n3. Review migration in `alembic/versions/`\n4. Run: `alembic upgrade head`\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-16*\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Read the corresponding stage plan (e.g., `plan/stage_plan_dev_v2/stage_*.md`)\n3. Understand the goals and functional requirements\n\n### Git Workflow\n\n- Commit messages should reference the stage: `feat(stage01): implement user model`\n- Commit after each stage test is passed\n- Avoid committing secrets, `.env` files, or large binary data\n- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- **Backend**: Use pytest - all tests must pass before commit\n- **Frontend**: Use Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E\n- Run full test suite before submitting: `npm run check` (frontend) + `pytest` (backend)\n\n### API Design\n\n- Follow RESTful conventions\n- Use Pydantic schemas for request/response validation\n- Document endpoints with docstrings\n- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n\n### Database\n\n- Use Alembic for migrations\n- Always generate migration after model changes\n- Use async SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Build, Lint, and Test Commands\n\n### Frontend (Next.js)\n\n```bash\n# Development\ncd frontend && npm run dev              # Start dev server on localhost:3000\ncd frontend && npm run build            # Production build\ncd frontend && npm run start            # Start production server\n\n# Linting & Type Checking\ncd frontend && npm run lint             # ESLint check\ncd frontend && npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type check (noEmit)\ncd frontend && npm run typecheck:next   # Next.js build without lint\n\n# Testing\ncd frontend && npm run test:unit        # Vitest unit tests\ncd frontend && npm run test:e2e          # Playwright E2E tests\ncd frontend && npm run test              # CI=1 playwright test (headless)\n\n# Run a single unit test\ncd frontend && npx vitest run src/path/to/test.test.ts\ncd frontend && npx vitest run --grep \"test name pattern\"\n\n# Combined checks\ncd frontend && npm run check             # lint + typecheck + test:unit\ncd frontend && npm run check:ci          # Full CI check (includes E2E)\n\n# Formatting\ncd frontend && npm run format            # Prettier write\ncd frontend && npm run format:check     # Prettier check\n```\n\n### Backend (FastAPI)\n\n```bash\n# Development\ncd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000\n\n# Celery Worker (for background tasks)\ncd backend && celery -A app.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=info\n\n# Run all tests\ncd backend && python -m pytest -v\ncd backend && bash tests/run_tests.sh\n\n# Run a single test\ncd backend && python -m pytest tests/test_filename.py::test_function_name -v\ncd backend && python -m pytest tests/test_filename.py -k \"test_pattern\" -v\n\n# Run tests with coverage\ncd backend && python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html\n\n# Database migrations\ncd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"migration name\"\ncd backend && alembic upgrade head\ncd backend && alembic downgrade -1\n```\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n```bash\n# Docker development environment\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# Production-like Docker\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Code Style Guidelines\n\n### Python (Backend)\n\n#### Imports (PEP 8)\n```python\n# Standard library\nfrom typing import Any, List, Optional\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Third-party\nfrom fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession\n\n# Local application\nfrom app.api import deps\nfrom app.models.user import User\nfrom app.schemas.project import ProjectCreate\nfrom app.services.project_service import ProjectService\n```\n\n#### Type Hints\n- Always use type hints for function parameters and return types\n- Use `Optional[T]` instead of `T | None` for compatibility\n- Prefer explicit return types: `async def foo() -> List[Project]:`\n\n#### Async/Await\n- Use async/await for all database operations\n- Always `await` database commits and queries\n- Use `AsyncSession` from `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio`\n\n#### Error Handling\n- Use `HTTPException` from FastAPI for HTTP errors\n- Include meaningful error messages and detail\n- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ProjectService`)\n- Functions/methods: `snake_case` (e.g., `create_project`)\n- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`\n- Database models: `PascalCase` matching table name\n- Pydantic schemas: `PascalCase` with suffix (e.g., `ProjectCreate`)\n\n#### File Organization\n- API endpoints: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`\n- Service layer: `backend/app/services/`\n- Models: `backend/app/models/`\n- Schemas: `backend/app/schemas/`\n- Workers: `backend/app/workers/`\n\n---\n\n### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)\n\n#### Path Aliases\n- `@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in tsconfig.json)\n- Use absolute imports: `import Button from \"@/components/ui/button\"`\n\n#### Client vs Server Components\n```typescript\n// Client component - for interactive UI\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\n// Server component - default, for data fetching\nimport { getData } from \"@/lib/api\";\n```\n\n#### Component Structure\n```typescript\n// Prefer this pattern for exports\nexport default function ComponentName() {\n  // component logic\n}\n\n// Named exports for utilities/hooks\nexport function helperFunction() { }\n```\n\n#### Naming Conventions\n- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `GitGraph.tsx`)\n- Hooks: `camelCase` with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuthToken`)\n- Utilities: `camelCase` (e.g., `cn.ts`)\n- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Project`)\n\n#### State Management\n- Server state: React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)\n- Client state: Zustand (`@/store/`)\n- Avoid useState for server-fetched data\n\n#### Tailwind CSS\n- Use existing design tokens from `tailwind.config.ts`\n- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS\n- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes\n\n---\n\n### Prettier Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"printWidth\": 100,\n  \"semi\": true,\n  \"singleQuote\": false,\n  \"trailingComma\": \"all\"\n}\n```\n\n### ESLint Configuration\n\n- Extends: `next/core-web-vitals`\n- Restricts Radix UI imports to `src/components/ui/` only\n- Override exists for UI component files\n\n---\n\n## 3. Project-Specific Guidelines\n\n### Before Starting Development\n\n1. **Always check** `plan/current_stage&FAQ.md` for current stage and priorities\n2. Read the corresponding stage plan (e.g., `plan/stage_plan_dev_v2/stage_*.md`)\n3. Understand the goals and functional requirements\n\n### Git Workflow\n\n- Commit messages should reference the stage: `feat(stage01): implement user model`\n- Commit after each stage test is passed\n- Avoid committing secrets, `.env` files, or large binary data\n- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n\n### Testing Requirements\n\n- **Backend**: Use pytest - all tests must pass before commit\n- **Frontend**: Use Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E\n- Run full test suite before submitting: `npm run check` (frontend) + `pytest` (backend)\n\n### API Design\n\n- Follow RESTful conventions\n- Use Pydantic schemas for request/response validation\n- Document endpoints with docstrings\n- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n\n### Database\n\n- Use Alembic for migrations\n- Always generate migration after model changes\n- Use async SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships\n\n---\n\n## 4. Technology Stack Reference\n\n| Layer | Technology |\n|-------|------------|\n| Backend Framework | FastAPI |\n| Database | PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy (async) |\n| Task Queue | Celery + RabbitMQ |\n| Cache | Redis |\n| Storage | MinIO/S3 |\n| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router) |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS |\n| State | Zustand + React Query |\n| Testing | Vitest + Playwright |\n| Linting | ESLint |\n| Formatting | Prettier |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Tasks Reference\n\n### Create a new API endpoint\n1. Add route in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`\n2. Add service method in `backend/app/services/`\n3. Add Pydantic schemas in `backend/app/schemas/`\n4. Add tests in `backend/tests/`\n\n### Create a new frontend component\n1. Add to `frontend/src/components/` (use existing patterns)\n2. Add UI components to `frontend/src/components/ui/`\n3. Use `@/lib/api/` for API calls\n4. Add tests in `frontend/src/__tests__/`\n\n### Database migration\n1. Modify model in `backend/app/models/`\n2. Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m \"description\"`\n3. Review migration in `alembic/versions/`\n4. Run: `alembic upgrade head`\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-16*\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/dubdoo/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
